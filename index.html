    <!-- Laura's game -->
    <div class="game" name="game1">
      <p class = "game-title">A Wacky Mole Game</p>
      <p>
        <b>By L. Zhou. </b> The rules are simple: You have 60 seconds to click on moles and earn as many points as possible.
        Just good old Whack-a-Mole, with a twist: <b>ECONOMY+ABILITIES</b>.

    <!-- Raymond's game -->
    <div class="game" name="game2">
      <p class = "game-title">Gamedev Canvas Workshop</p>
      <p>
        <b>By R. Qian. </b> Try to survive as long as possible without touching any red. Yellow indicates that it will become red soon. This game is best played on a monitor instead of a laptop.

    <!-- Kayley's game -->
    <div class="game" name="game3">
      <p class = "game-title">Tic Tac Toe</p>
      <p>
         <b>By K. Seow. </b> In order to run the Tic Tac Toe game, press the "run" button in the center. 
        In order to see the code which I wrote for this program, click "open in repl.it" and it will direct you to my java repl. 
        The instructions will appear when you run the program. 
        If you want to stop the program at any time, click "stop" and if you want to play again, click the "run" button again. Have fun!
